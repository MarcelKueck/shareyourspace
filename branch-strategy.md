# ShareYourSpace Branch Strategy

Our branch strategy is aligned with our phased development approach to ensure structured, milestone-based progress.

## Main Branches

- `main` - Production branch, always deployable
- `staging` - Pre-production testing branch
- `development` - Primary development branch

## Phase-Based Branches

### Phase 1: Core Marketplace & Compliance (Months 1-4)
Base branch: `phase/1-core`

Feature branches:
- `feature/auth-system`
- `feature/user-profiles`
- `feature/space-management`
- `feature/basic-booking`
- `feature/compliance-foundation`
- `feature/landing-page`

### Phase 2: Network Enhancement & Basic AI (Months 5-8)
Base branch: `phase/2-network`

Feature branches:
- `feature/matching-basics`
- `feature/space-utilization`
- `feature/assistant-basic`
- `feature/enhanced-compliance`
- `feature/analytics-dashboard`

### Phase 3: Data Intelligence & Basic InnovationMatch (Months 9-12)
Base branch: `phase/3-intelligence`

Feature branches:
- `feature/predictive-recommendations`
- `feature/innovation-match-platform`
- `feature/network-visualization`
- `feature/assistant-personalization`
- `feature/advanced-booking`

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Year 2)
Base branch: `phase/4-advanced`

Feature branches:
- `feature/full-innovation-match`
- `feature/data-products`
- `feature/expanded-compliance`
- `feature/advanced-assistant`

## Temporary Branches

- `hotfix/*` - Urgent bug fixes deployed directly to production
- `release/v*.*.*` - Release preparation branches
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates

## Workflow Process

1. New features are developed in feature branches forked from their respective phase branch
2. Feature PRs are merged into the phase branch after code review
3. When all features for a phase milestone are complete, the phase branch is merged into `development`
4. `development` is merged into `staging` for testing
5. After thorough testing, `staging` is merged into `main` for production deployment
6. Hotfixes follow an expedited process directly to `main` when necessary

This branch strategy ensures:
- Clear organization based on our phased development approach
- Isolation of work in progress
- Milestone-based progress tracking
- Clean production deployments
